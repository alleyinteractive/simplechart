## Metadata

Metadata – including title, subtitle, notes, and source – can be entered in the **Data Input** (title only) or **Settings** steps. These fields will be displayed when the chart is embedded in a post. The subtitle field is disabled by default and can be enabled by site-specific setup.

Although this metadata is optional *for Simplechart*, your CMS (e.g. WordPress) may require a title before saving the chart in the database. In this case, you may need to enter a post title directly in the CMS before saving the chart, if you have not already added a title in the Simplechart app.
