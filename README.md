Quickly create and structure interactive charts for use in a content management system (CMS).

*See [Simplechart for WordPress](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wordpress-simplechart) for the WordPress plugin.*

## Quick Start
You'll need just a couple things installed before running Simplechart.

- Node
- NPM

You can confirm these packages are installed by running `node -v` or `npm -v` from your terminal.

1. Clone the Simplechart repository to your local machine using `git clone git@github.com:alleyinteractive/simplechart.git`.
2. Change directory to your newly created folder using `cd simplechart`.
3. Install the Node packages listed in *package.json* by running `npm install`.
4. Start the Node app using `npm start`.

Congrats! You should now be able to access Simplechart at `http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

If you're ready to deploy the app, head over to the Wiki for the [Deployment Guide](TK).

## Use Cases
Simplechart provides the most utility at present when used in conjunction with the WordPress plugin. You don't need to install this package to try the WordPress plugin.

Although we have focused on WordPress to date, Simplechart itself is CMS agnostic, and can even be used without a CMS. Simplechart allows you to control your own data, and customize default styling to maintain visual consistency with your brand.

Simplechart runs on modern web technology – React, WebPack, and ES5 – and Simplechart widgets are **AMP-compatible** out of the box.

Simplechart is and always will be free as in beer, and the code is licensed under [GPL-2.0](https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/). 

## Extending Simplechart
Over on the Wiki, we've documented some common extensions for Simplechart.
